* Problems reading in data


** Commas in prices
Some of the prices are listed with commas in the amount,
e.g. "3,727.00", and so needed quoting in the CSV format.  To keep the
numbers as digits only, I've removed the commas from those files using
a sed script (see Makefile).

This was done with some regexp hacking:

"3,727.00 "

'"[0-9]+,[0-9.]+ "'

Take two: the regexp needs to account for optional - sign at the front of the number


** Typo in header line for IA
IA.csv has a typo in the header line, with a line break in "Final Net Price"; this was edited by hand.


** Typo in header line for WVU

"Titles" column should be "Title"



** ISU ALPs are the wrong sign

ALPs are +ve in the file, yet they should be negative, as differences
are negative,.


"Discrete Maths" is out of alphabetical order (have left)
