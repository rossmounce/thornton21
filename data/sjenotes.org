Need some regexp hacking here:

"3,727.00 "

'"[0-9]+,[0-9.]+ "'

Take two: the regexp needs to account for optional - sign at the front of the number

IA.csv has a typo in the header line, with a line break in "Final Net Price"; this was edited by hand.


** Problems

*** ISU:

ALPs are +ve in the file, yet they should be negative.

"Discrete Maths" is out of alphabetical order.


*** WVU

"Titles" column should be "Title"
